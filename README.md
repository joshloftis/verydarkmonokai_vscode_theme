## Personal VSCode Theme

This is a personal theme for VSCode. It's based off of Monokai Pro and Gotham.

### To use this theme

```
git clone git@github.com:jshlfts32/verydarkmonokai_vscode_theme.git
cd verydarkmonokai_vscode_theme
rm -rf .git
```

(The last command isn't necessary, but there really isn't any need for you to have this repo versioned with git once downloaded.)

If on a Mac...

```
cd ..
cp -a verydarkmonokai_vscode_theme ~/.vscode/extensions/
```

If on PC, all you need to do is move the `verydarkmonokai_vscode_theme` directory into the `extensions` directory for VSCode, but I'm not sure how this is done for Windows...

Finally, launch VSCode

```
code
```

In VSCode select `Code > Perferences > Color Theme` or `⌘ K ⌘ T`. Finally, select `Darker Monokai`.

To use the icon theme, in VSCODE select `Code > Perferences > File Icon Theme` and then select `very_dark_monokai_icons`.

I also suggest installing and using Operator Mono - a great font for coding!

**Enjoy!**
